This report summarizes a simulated phishing campaign conducted to evaluate user awareness and identify potential weaknesses in organizational security posture. The simulation was performed using GoPhish, an open-source phishing framewor

Objective
To test the effectiveness of phishing emails and assess how users respond to suspicious links and requests.

Tools Used

1. GoPhish (https://getgophish.com)

2. SMTP test server

3. Custom HTML email template

4. Ngrok (https://ngrok.com)

4. Campaign Setup

Theme: Password Expiration Notice

Email Subject: "Your Password Will Expire in 24 Hours"

Phishing Link: Simulated login page mimicking an internal company portal, exposed to the internet using Ngrok

Recipients: 3 test accounts (simulated environment)

5. Execution

GoPhish was installed and configured on a Windows machine.

Ngrok was used to create a secure public URL for the phishing site hosted locally.

A phishing email template was designed to appear legitimate and urgent.

A campaign was launched targeting 3 simulated users.

Email tracking was enabled to log actions like email opens, link clicks, and data submission.

7. Observations

Most users responded to urgent-sounding emails.

Visual cues in the fake login page were convincing enough for some to enter credentials.

Ngrok made it easy to share the phishing page externally during testing.

8. Recommendations

Conduct regular security awareness training.

Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users.

Implement email filtering and link scanning tools.

Use banners to mark emails coming from outside the organization.

9. Conclusion
The phishing simulation revealed a moderate level of user susceptibility. With continued training and better email security tools, the risk can be significantly reduced.
